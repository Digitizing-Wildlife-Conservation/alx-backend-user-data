0x03. User authentication service Back-end Authentification Cohort

The User Authentication Service project involves creating a user authentication system using SQLAlchemy 1.3.x, pycodestyle 2.5, bcrypt, and Python 3.7. Key tasks include developing a User model in user.py that maps to a users table with attributes such as id, email, hashed_password, session_id, and reset_token. Additionally, db.py implements a DB class with an add_user method to add new users to the database.
