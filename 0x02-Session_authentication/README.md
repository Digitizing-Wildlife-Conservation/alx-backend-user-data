0x02. Session authentication Back-end Authentification Cohort

This project involves implementing session authentication, building on previous work with Basic authentication. It includes copying past work, adding a new endpoint (GET /users/me) to retrieve the authenticated user, and ensuring all previous tasks are completed. Additionally, it involves creating an empty SessionAuth class, inheriting from Auth, and updating the application to use SessionAuth based on an environment variable. The project requires updates to specific routes and request handling to integrate the new session authentication mechanism.
